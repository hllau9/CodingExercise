# CodingExercise
The coding exercise for one of the job applications.

1. The application has been configured to use AutoFac as the IoC container, Dapper as the data access technology.
2. There are two ways to export list of users into excel and pdf namely by using export functionalities provided by jQuery Datatables and by using my own generic export methods that can take different models.
3. AutoFac has to be wired up manually for this project as ASP MVC 5 doesn't ship with a default IoC container.
